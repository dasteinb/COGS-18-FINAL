    "The interface/game works by the user clicking the box for which they want more information, and the screen displays some paragraphs of information. As the user clicks a sepecific area of the screen, a function (with many other functoinns within it) expands the screen, creates a title, and pastes the information from the website.  \n",

    "1. The red x button doesn't work for some reason, so the kernal must be restarted to exit out of the pygame interface. \n",

    "Extra credit:\n",
    "For this project, I used a a package that we haven't used in class: pygame. It ended up being a lot more challennging that I thought it would be to learn how to use a new package. In class, we didn't talk about interactive interfaces and presenting information. A struggle I had in particular was getting the user's clicks to register each time, and the amount of time the information side bar was displayed. I worked around this by using a delay in the code. \n",
